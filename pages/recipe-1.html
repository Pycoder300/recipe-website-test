           <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pasta: </strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente according to the<br> package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce: </strong>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese until<br> well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale: </strong>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale until it becomes<br> crispy and golden brown. Add minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant. Remove the skillet from heat.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Combine Everything: </strong>While the pancetta is still hot, add the drained pasta to the skillet. Toss to combine,<br> allowing the pasta to absorb the flavors of the pancetta and garlic.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Add the Egg Mixture: </strong>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Toss vigorously to coat the<br> pasta evenly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add the reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Serve and Garnish: </strong>Divide the pasta among serving plates. Garnish with additional grated cheese, freshly<br> ground black pepper, and chopped parsley. Serve immediately and enjoy the heavenly<br> flavors of Pasta Carbonara!</li><br>
        </ol>
