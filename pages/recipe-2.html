                Instructions:
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken: </strong>In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with half of the chopped garlic, grated ginger, curry<br> powder, turmeric powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Let it marinate for<br> at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics: </strong>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic and finely chopped red chili.<br> Sauté until aromatic. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Cook the Chicken: </strong>Add the marinated chicken to the pan. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides and cooked<br> through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Mango Sauce: </strong>In the same pan, add the diced mangoes. Cook until they become soft and slightly caramelized. Using a fork or a masher, mash the mangoes to create a sauce-like consistency.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Combine and Simmer: </strong>Return the cooked chicken to the pan with the mango sauce. Stir well to coat the chicken with<br> the sauce. Let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Adjust seasoning<br> with salt and pepper according to taste.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Serve and Garnish: </strong>Serve the Spicy Mango Chicken over cooked rice. Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro for a burst<br> of freshness and color. Enjoy this spicy, fruity, and savory dish that will take your taste buds on a<br> tantalizing journey.</li><br>
            </ol>

                Tips:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjust Spice Level: </strong>Control the spice level by adding or reducing the amount of red chili according<br> to your preference. For a milder version, remove the seeds from the chili before chopping.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Ripe Mangoes: </strong>Use ripe mangoes for the sauce. They should be sweet and juicy to enhance the<br> natural sweetness of the dish.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Side Suggestions: </strong>Pair the Spicy Mango Chicken with naan bread or steamed vegetables for a<br> complete and balanced meal.</li>
