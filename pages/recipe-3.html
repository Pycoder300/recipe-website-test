                Instructions:
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat and Prepare: </strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a 9x9-inch (23x23cm) baking pan with<br> parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Mix the Batter: </strong>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla extract,<br> and whisk until well combined. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt.<br> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the<br> chocolate chips.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Bake the Brownies: </strong>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven<br> for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist<br> crumbs. Be careful not to overbake.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Make the Chocolate Ganache: </strong>While the brownies are cooling, prepare the chocolate ganache. In a small saucepan, heat the<br> heavy cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat and add the<br> chocolate chips and butter. Let it sit for a minute to melt, then whisk until smooth and glossy.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Frost the Brownies: </strong>Once the brownies have completely cooled, pour the chocolate ganache over the top, spreading<br> it evenly with a spatula. Allow the ganache to set for a few hours at room temperature or in the refrigerator.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Slice and Enjoy: </strong>Use the parchment paper overhangs to lift the brownies out of the pan. Place on a cutting board<br> and, using a sharp knife, cut into squares. Serve and enjoy these decadent chocolate brownies<br> with your favorite hot beverage or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
            </ol>

                Tips:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Chocolate: </strong> Use high-quality chocolate for both the brownies and the ganache to enhance<br> the rich chocolate flavor.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Cooling Time: </strong>Allow the brownies to cool completely before cutting to achieve clean, neat slices.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Storage: </strong> Store leftover brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or<br> refrigerate for longer shelf life.</li>
